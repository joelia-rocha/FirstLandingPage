      <p class="text2">The time passes quickly so be sure to enjoy every second, 
        Because time will become infinite. 
        You can’t keep today’s hour for tomorrow – we all know that, 
        but still tend to procrastinate. Benjamin Franklin warns that 
        time is a scarce resource, and if it’s wasted, it cannot be 
        recovered later. This is why mindful planning and work on 
        productivity are so important.<br>We kill time. We save time. 
        We rob and get robbed of time, we lose time, and we have all 
        the time in the world. But no one of us is powerful enough to 
        stop the march of time or slow it down.
        Is it something far beyond our control? In fact, no. 
        While we cannot influence the flow of time, we still can get 
        the most out of it. Becoming a wise time manager sometimes is 
        similar to mastering a sorcery, ut the results are worth the 
        effort. Being the master of your time means getting more done, 
        staying energized, and doing more things you enjoy. 
        We’ve collected the best time quotes from the greatest minds of 
        the world – use them as an inspiration or as 
        guidelines for improving your time management.
        We kill time. We save time. We rob and get robbed of time,
